# Hoidle

Hoidle is my little project inspired by **Loldle**, but instead of using League of Legends champions, it uses **Hearts of Iron IV (HOI4) countries**.

## How it works
- You eneter the name of any country in HOI4.
- You will be given a series of clues related to a country.
- Your goal is to guess the country based on these clues.
  
## Current Version

Currently, the project contains only **"Classic Mode"** but I plan to add more modes in the future.
